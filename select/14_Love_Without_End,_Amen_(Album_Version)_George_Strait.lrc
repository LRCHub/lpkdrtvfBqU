[00:06.19] I got sent home from school one day
[00:08.59] With a shiner on my eye
[00:11.36] Fightin' was against the rules and it didn't matter why
[00:17.26] When Dad got home I told that story just like I'd rehearsed
[00:24.03] Then stood there on those tremblin' knees
[00:27.54] And waited for the worst
[00:39.54] 
[00:30.74] He said, "Let me tell you a secret about a father's love
[00:36.32] A secret that my daddy said was just between us"
[00:43.07] He said, "Daddies don't just love their children
[00:46.18] Every now and then, It's a love without end, amen
[00:55.60] It's a love without end, amen
[01:10.10] 
[01:01.24] When I became a father in the spring of '81
[01:06.50] There was no doubt that stubborn boy
[01:09.57] Was just like my father's son
[01:13.16] And when I thought my patience
[01:15.97] Had been tested to the end
[01:20.17] I took my daddy's secret and passed it on to him
[01:44.17] 
[01:26.33] I said, "Let me tell you a secret about a father's love
[01:32.30] A secret that my daddy said was just between us"
[01:38.73] I said, "Daddies don't just love their children
[01:43.00] Every now and then It's a love without end, amen
[01:51.12] It's a love without end, amen"
[02:06.12] 
[01:59.23] Last night I dreamed I died and stood outside those pearly gates
[02:05.04] When suddenly I realized there must be some mistake
[02:13.34] If they know half the things I've done
[02:16.01] They'll never let me in
[02:19.67] Then somewhere from the other side I heard those words again
[02:49.67] 
[02:26.38] They said, "Let me tell you a secret about a father's love
[02:32.06] A secret that my daddy said was just between us
[02:38.99] You see, daddies don't just love their children
[02:42.98] Every now and then It's a love without end, amen
[02:52.55] It's a love without end, amen"
